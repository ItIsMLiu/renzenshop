# renzenshop
Website for curtain shop

## Description 

This renzenshop project was created using React to develop the initial scaffolding of the website. The purpose of the website is for an online curtain shop. It includes essential details such as home page, products, services, about page and contact information.

All files were created from scratch, incorporating skills in utilizing React. Below, I've highlighted the integration of these skills within the project:

* React
* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third-party router

The URL of the deployed application: https://itismliu.github.io/renzenshop/

## Installation

N/A

## Usage 

To use the webpage, you can go through its various sections to explore infomation. If you wish to review a specific page, simply utilise the navigation bar located at the top right corner. From there, select one of the options: 'Home', 'Services', 'Contact' etc by clicking on your choice. This will promptly take you to the desired section on the webpage, where you can delve into the section contents.

This webpage is compatible with various screen sizes, as its layout will automatically respond and adapt. 

The graphics of the links in the navigation bar, hero, contact, project and footer section will dynamically change as you hover the cursor over them.

In the contact section, links to the contact methods will directly prompt you to email, call etc.

The footer section contains copyright information and an 'email now!' call-to-action button.
